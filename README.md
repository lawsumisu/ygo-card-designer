# ygo-card-designer
A modern _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ card editor built with React. The goal of this project is to make a form-less editor; the traditional input form has been replaced with a canvas-like interface that allows users to edit cards directly and see their changes in realtime.

## Setup
This project uses npm to manage dependencies. Download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once npm has been installed, run `npm install` to download dependencies.  
Run `npm start` to start the webpack bundler and server that hosts the app.  
Once the server has started successfully, navigate to http://localhost:8080.
